Dear all,

It is with regret that we have to announce the postponement of the tess.science meeting scheduled for 29th June to 3rd July 2020.  We can see no way of holding an in person meeting or simply switching the tess.science meeting to a remote meeting with the same format.  Below you will find further details on our postponement plans, and plans for a remote meeting with a new format optimised for remote participation.

The venue we booked has offered to rearrange the in-person meeting to a new date in 2021 for no additional cost and we are looking into new dates.  We will attempt to keep the meeting in the weeks leading up to, or after Cool Stars to help minimise travel times and carbon footprints.  For now, we wait for the Cool Stars team to finalise their dates.

In the meantime, we are planning a replacement meeting to be held remotely.  We are designing a shorter meeting that will let us use all the opportunities that remote work gives while trying to mitigate other challenges (for example time zones).  For this reason, the remote meeting will feel quite different from a usual tess.science but we are excited about the possibilities that the new mode of 'un-conferencing' will bring.

The tess.science team wishes you well and hopes to see you (remotely at first) soon.  Please watch out for further announcements as we really want to keep all involved in the tess.science community.

In the midst of chaos, there is opportunity - let's find new TESS science together.
